Dear,

I have concluded performance test on frequently used API for Blazedemo web application.
Test performed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://blazedemo.com/

100 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Sample is ~ 29 And Total Concurrent API requested: 5600.
200 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Sample is ~ 44 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7600.
300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Sample is ~ 73 And Total Concurrent API requested: 8400.
400 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Sample is ~ 104 And Total Concurrent API requested: 11110.
600 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Sample is ~ 150 And Total Concurrent API requested: 15402.


While executed 600 concurrent request, found 13200 request got connection timeout and error rate is 8.3%

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 340 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

I have attached the full report, please let me know if further query is needed.
